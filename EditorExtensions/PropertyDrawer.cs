//Prefer property drawers over custom editors.
//Property drawers are implement per field type, and is therefore much less work to implement.
//They are also more re-suable – once implemented for a type, they can be used for that type in any class.
//Custom editors are implemented per MonoBehaviour, and are therefor less re-usable and more work.
